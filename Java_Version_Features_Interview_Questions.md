- **Lazy evaluation**: Operations only execute when terminal operation is called

**Q3: What is the Optional class and how does it help with null pointer exceptions?**
**Answer:** Optional is a container that may or may not contain a non-null value:
- Explicitly represents the possibility of absence
- Methods: isPresent(), ifPresent(), orElse(), orElseThrow()
- Encourages defensive programming
- Makes null handling explicit in API design
