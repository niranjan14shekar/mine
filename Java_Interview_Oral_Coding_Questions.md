#### 3. Grouping Objects by Property
**Question:** "You have a list of Order objects with customer names. How would you group all orders by customer name? Explain the approach."

#### 4. Sorting Objects by Multiple Criteria
**Question:** "How would you sort a list of Book objects first by author name, then by publication year? Describe your approach."

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**

- Use mapping libraries like MapStruct or ModelMapper
- Manual conversion method with null safety
- Consider performance for large datasets
- Batch processing for very large lists

#### 10. Implementing Observer Pattern for Object Changes
**Question:** "You have a ShoppingCart object and want to notify multiple listeners (UI, logging, analytics) when items are added/removed. How would you design this?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Implement Observer pattern with List<CartListener>
- Event-driven architecture with custom events
- Use PropertyChangeListener for specific field changes
- Consider using existing event libraries
- Discuss synchronous vs asynchronous notifications
- Thread safety for multiple listeners

### Difficult Level (Advanced Problem-Solving)

#### 11. Designing Thread-Safe Object Pool
**Question:** "Design an object pool for expensive-to-create database connections. The pool should be thread-safe, have max capacity, and reuse connections efficiently. Walk me through your design."

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Use BlockingQueue for thread-safe pool management
- acquire() and release() methods with timeout
- Connection validation before reuse
- Max pool size and connection lifecycle management
- Handle connection leaks with weak references
- Consider existing solutions like HikariCP
- Monitoring and metrics for pool health

#### 12. Implementing Custom Equals and HashCode
**Question:** "You have a Person class with firstName, lastName, and dateOfBirth. Two persons are equal if all three fields match. How would you implement equals() and hashCode()? What are the important considerations?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Override both equals() and hashCode() together
- Check for null values and handle appropriately
- Use Objects.equals() for null-safe comparison
- HashCode should use same fields as equals()
- Symmetric, reflexive, and transitive properties
- Consider performance and hash distribution
- Immutable objects are safer for hashing

#### 13. Memory-Efficient Processing of Large Object Collections
