# Java Interview Gotcha Questions

## Tricky Scenarios That Test Deep Java Knowledge

### 1. Integer Caching Surprise
**Question:** "You're comparing Integer objects and getting inconsistent results. The comparison `Integer a = 100; Integer b = 100; System.out.println(a == b);` prints true, but `Integer c = 200; Integer d = 200; System.out.println(c == d);` prints false. Why?"

**Complete Answer:**
This behavior occurs due to Java's Integer caching mechanism, also known as the "flyweight pattern" implementation for wrapper classes. Here's the detailed explanation:

**Integer Caching Range:**
- Java caches Integer objects for values from -128 to 127 (inclusive)
- This range is defined by the JVM specification and can be extended via `-XX:AutoBoxCacheMax=<size>` JVM parameter
- When you use autoboxing or `Integer.valueOf()` with values in this range, the JVM returns the same cached object instance

**Why This Happens:**
```java
Integer a = 100;  // Autoboxing calls Integer.valueOf(100)
Integer b = 100;  // Returns the SAME cached object
System.out.println(a == b);  // true - same object reference

Integer c = 200;  // Creates a NEW Integer object
Integer d = 200;  // Creates another NEW Integer object  
System.out.println(c == d);  // false - different object references
```

**Other Wrapper Classes Affected:**
- Byte: all values (-128 to 127)
- Short: -128 to 127
- Long: -128 to 127
- Character: 0 to 127
- Boolean: true and false are cached

**Best Practices:**
- Always use `.equals()` for wrapper class comparisons
- Be aware that autoboxing can hide this behavior
- Use primitive types when possible for performance
- Understand that `new Integer(100)` always creates a new object (deprecated in Java 9+)

**Expected Discussion Points:**
- Java caches Integer objects from -128 to 127 for memory optimization
- Same cached objects are reused within this range, making == work
- Outside this range, new objects are created, so == fails
- This applies to Byte (-128 to 127), Short (-128 to 127), Long (-128 to 127), Character (0 to 127)
- Always use equals() for wrapper class comparisons
- Autoboxing makes this behavior subtle and dangerous

### 2. String Concatenation Memory Trap
**Question:** "You have two similar pieces of code. `String s1 = "Hello" + "World";` and `String s2 = "Hello"; String s3 = s2 + "World";`. When you compare with ==, one works and the other doesn't. Explain why."

**Complete Answer:**
This behavior demonstrates the difference between compile-time string concatenation and runtime string concatenation, affecting where strings are stored in memory.

**Compile-time vs Runtime Concatenation:**

**Case 1: Compile-time concatenation**
```java
String s1 = "Hello" + "World";  // Evaluated at compile time
String s4 = "HelloWorld";       // String literal
System.out.println(s1 == s4);   // true - both reference same pool object
```

**Case 2: Runtime concatenation**
```java
String s2 = "Hello";            // Stored in string pool
String s3 = s2 + "World";       // Creates NEW object on heap
String s4 = "HelloWorld";       // String literal in pool
System.out.println(s3 == s4);   // false - different memory locations
System.out.println(s3.equals(s4)); // true - same content
```

**Memory Allocation Details:**
- **String Pool (Intern Pool):** Special memory area in heap for string literals and compile-time constants
- **Heap:** Regular memory where new objects are created during runtime
- **Compile-time constants:** String literals and final String concatenations are stored in pool
- **Runtime concatenation:** Creates new objects on heap using StringBuilder internally

**String Interning:**
```java
String s3 = s2 + "World";       // On heap
String s5 = s3.intern();        // Move to pool if not present
String s4 = "HelloWorld";       // Pool reference
System.out.println(s5 == s4);   // true - both in pool
```

**Performance Implications:**
- Pool references are memory efficient (shared objects)
- Runtime concatenation in loops creates many temporary objects
- Use StringBuilder for multiple concatenations
- String pool has size limits (can cause OutOfMemoryError)

**Compiler Optimization:**
```java
final String prefix = "Hello";  // final makes it compile-time constant
String result = prefix + "World"; // Treated as "Hello" + "World"
```

**Expected Discussion Points:**
- Compile-time constants are stored in string pool
- `"Hello" + "World"` is evaluated at compile time and stored in pool
- Variable concatenation creates new objects on heap
- String pool vs heap memory differences
- String interning behavior
- StringBuilder usage for concatenation in loops
- Performance implications of string operations

### 3. Array Initialization Gotcha
**Question:** "You declare `int[] arr = new int[5];` and `Integer[] arr2 = new Integer[5];`. When you print `arr[0]` and `arr2[0]`, you get different results. What's happening?"

**Complete Answer:**
This illustrates the fundamental difference between primitive arrays and object arrays in Java's default initialization behavior.

**Primitive Array Initialization:**
```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
System.out.println(arr[0]);  // Prints: 0
```

**Object Array Initialization:**
```java
Integer[] arr2 = new Integer[5];
System.out.println(arr2[0]); // Prints: null
```

**Default Values for Primitive Arrays:**
- `int[]`: 0
- `double[]`: 0.0
- `boolean[]`: false
- `char[]`: '\u0000' (null character)
- `byte[]`: 0
- `short[]`: 0
- `long[]`: 0L
- `float[]`: 0.0f

**Object Arrays Always Initialize to null:**
- `String[]`: null references
- `Integer[]`: null references
- `Object[]`: null references
- Any custom class array: null references

**Potential Problems:**
```java
Integer[] numbers = new Integer[5];
numbers[0] += 10;  // NullPointerException! 
// Cannot unbox null Integer to int

// Safe approach:
Integer[] numbers = new Integer[5];
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    numbers[i] = 0;  // Explicitly initialize
}
numbers[0] += 10;  // Now safe
```

**Autoboxing Limitations:**
```java
Integer[] arr = new Integer[5];
arr[0] = 42;  // Autoboxing works for assignment
int value = arr[1];  // NullPointerException! arr[1] is null
```

**Best Practices:**
1. **Initialize object arrays explicitly:**
```java
Integer[] arr = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};  // Array literal
// or
Arrays.fill(arr, 0);  // Fill with default value
```

2. **Use Collections for object wrapper types:**
```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(5, 0));
```

3. **Check for null before operations:**
```java
if (arr[0] != null) {
    arr[0] += 10;
}
```

**Memory Perspective:**
- Primitive arrays store actual values
- Object arrays store references (initially null)
- Each element must be explicitly assigned an object reference

**Expected Discussion Points:**
- Primitive arrays are initialized with default values (0 for int, false for boolean, etc.)
- Object arrays are initialized with null references
- Default values vs null references
- NullPointerException risks with object arrays
- Autoboxing doesn't help with array initialization
- Best practices for array initialization

### 4. Floating Point Precision Trap
**Question:** "You write `System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);` and expect true, but get false. How would you explain this to a confused developer?"

**Complete Answer:**
This is one of the most fundamental gotchas in computer science, related to how computers represent decimal numbers in binary format.

**The Problem Demonstration:**
```java
System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2);       // Prints: 0.30000000000000004
System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3); // Prints: false
```

**Root Cause - Binary Representation:**
- Computers store floating-point numbers in binary (base-2) format
- Many decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly in binary
- 0.1 in decimal = 0.00011001100110011... (repeating) in binary
- This leads to rounding errors when stored in finite memory

**IEEE 754 Standard:**
- Java uses IEEE 754 double-precision (64-bit) format
- 1 sign bit + 11 exponent bits + 52 mantissa bits
- Even with 64 bits, some decimal values cannot be represented exactly
- The closest binary approximation is stored, causing tiny errors

**Detailed Example:**
```java
double a = 0.1;
double b = 0.2;
double c = 0.3;
System.out.println("a = " + a);     // 0.1
System.out.println("b = " + b);     // 0.2  
System.out.println("c = " + c);     // 0.3
System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b)); // 0.30000000000000004
System.out.println("Difference: " + Math.abs((a + b) - c)); // 5.551115123125783E-17
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Epsilon Comparison:**
```java
public static boolean isEqual(double a, double b, double epsilon) {
    return Math.abs(a - b) < epsilon;
}

double result = 0.1 + 0.2;
System.out.println(isEqual(result, 0.3, 1e-10)); // true
```

**2. BigDecimal for Exact Arithmetic:**
```java
BigDecimal a = new BigDecimal("0.1");  // Use string constructor!
BigDecimal b = new BigDecimal("0.2");
BigDecimal c = new BigDecimal("0.3");
BigDecimal sum = a.add(b);
System.out.println(sum.equals(c));     // true

// Avoid double constructor:
BigDecimal wrong = new BigDecimal(0.1); // Inherits precision error
```

**3. Scale and Round for Financial Applications:**
```java
BigDecimal price = new BigDecimal("19.99");
BigDecimal tax = new BigDecimal("0.08");
BigDecimal total = price.multiply(tax.add(BigDecimal.ONE));
total = total.setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP); // Round to 2 decimal places
```

**Performance Considerations:**
- `double/float` arithmetic: Very fast, hardware-optimized
- `BigDecimal` arithmetic: Slower, but exact for decimal calculations
- Choose based on requirements: speed vs precision

**When to Use Each:**
- **float/double:** Scientific calculations, graphics, general math where small errors are acceptable
- **BigDecimal:** Financial calculations, currency, any scenario requiring exact decimal precision
- **int (scaled):** Sometimes multiply by 100 to work with cents instead of dollars

**Expected Discussion Points:**
- Binary representation of decimal numbers is imprecise
- IEEE 754 floating point standard limitations
- Use BigDecimal for precise decimal calculations
- Epsilon comparison for floating point equality
- Financial applications require exact decimal arithmetic
- Performance vs precision trade-offs

### 5. Method Overloading Resolution Surprise
**Question:** "You have overloaded methods `void process(Object obj)` and `void process(String str)`. When you call `process(null)`, which method gets called and why?"

**Complete Answer:**
This demonstrates Java's method overloading resolution rules, which prioritize the most specific applicable method at compile time.

**Simple Case - Most Specific Wins:**
```java
public class MethodResolution {
    public void process(Object obj) {
        System.out.println("Object version");
    }
    
    public void process(String str) {
        System.out.println("String version");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MethodResolution mr = new MethodResolution();
        mr.process(null);  // Prints: "String version"
    }
}
```

**Why String is Chosen:**
- `null` can be assigned to any reference type
- Both `Object` and `String` are applicable (can accept null)
- `String` is more specific than `Object` (String extends Object)
- Java compiler chooses the most specific method that matches

**Compilation Error Case:**
```java
public void process(String str) { }
public void process(Integer num) { }

process(null);  // Compilation Error: Ambiguous method call
// Both String and Integer are equally specific relative to null
```

**Method Resolution Priority (JLS §15.12.2):**

**Phase 1: Exact Match**
```java
process("hello");  // Exact match to process(String)
```

**Phase 2: Widening Primitive Conversion**
```java
void process(int i) { }
void process(long l) { }
process((byte)5);  // Calls process(int) - byte widens to int
```

**Phase 3: Autoboxing**
```java
void process(Integer i) { }
process(5);  // int autoboxed to Integer
```

**Phase 4: Varargs**
```java
void process(String... args) { }
process("a", "b");  // Varargs has lowest priority
```

**Complex Inheritance Example:**
```java
class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal { }
class Poodle extends Dog { }

void feed(Animal a) { System.out.println("Animal"); }
void feed(Dog d) { System.out.println("Dog"); }

feed(new Poodle());  // Prints "Dog" - most specific applicable method
feed((Animal)new Poodle());  // Prints "Animal" - explicit cast
```

**Null and Interfaces:**
```java
interface Drawable { }
class Shape implements Drawable { }

void render(Drawable d) { System.out.println("Drawable"); }
void render(Shape s) { System.out.println("Shape"); }

render(null);  // Prints "Shape" - class is more specific than interface
```

**Pitfalls and Best Practices:**

**1. Avoid Ambiguous Overloads:**
```java
// Bad - confusing
public void setValue(String s) { }
public void setValue(Object o) { }

// Better - use different method names
public void setName(String name) { }
public void setData(Object data) { }
```

**2. Primitive vs Wrapper Confusion:**
```java
void process(int i) { System.out.println("int"); }
void process(Integer i) { System.out.println("Integer"); }

process(5);     // "int" - exact match wins over autoboxing
process(null);  // "Integer" - int cannot be null
```

**3. Varargs Gotchas:**
```java
void process(String s) { }
void process(String... args) { }

process("hello");  // Calls process(String) - exact match over varargs
process();         // Calls process(String...) - only applicable method
```

**Debugging Tips:**
- Use IDE to see which method is selected
- Add `@Override` when you think you're overriding
- Use different method names to avoid confusion
- Be explicit with casts when needed

**Expected Discussion Points:**
- Java chooses the most specific type that matches
- String is more specific than Object
- Compile-time method resolution
- Ambiguous method calls lead to compilation errors
- Varargs method resolution priority
- Method overloading vs overriding differences

- Defensive copying necessity
- Immutable alternatives (LocalDate, LocalDateTime)
- API design with mutable objects
- Builder pattern for date construction
- Thread safety implications

### 12. Array Covariance Surprise
