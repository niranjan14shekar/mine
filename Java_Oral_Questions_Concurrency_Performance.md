# Java Oral Coding Questions - Concurrency & Performance

## 10 Questions on Concurrency and Performance

### 1. Thread-Safe Object Processing
**Question:** "You have multiple threads updating a shared counter object. How would you ensure thread safety without blocking threads unnecessarily?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- AtomicInteger for simple counters
- Synchronized methods vs blocks
- Lock-free programming with CAS operations
- Performance comparison of different approaches
- Avoiding race conditions
- Read-write locks for read-heavy scenarios

### 2. Producer-Consumer with Blocking Queue
**Question:** "Design a system where multiple producer threads generate tasks and multiple consumer threads process them. How would you handle the coordination?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- BlockingQueue for thread-safe communication
- Different queue implementations (ArrayBlocking, Linked)
- Handling queue capacity and backpressure
- Graceful shutdown mechanisms
- ExecutorService as alternative
- Monitoring queue size and performance

### 3. Caching Strategy for Expensive Operations
**Question:** "You have a method that calculates complex statistics for datasets. How would you implement thread-safe caching with expiration?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe caching
- TTL implementation with timestamps
- Cache eviction strategies (LRU, size-based)
- Read-through vs write-behind caching
- Memory considerations and weak references
- External cache solutions (Redis, Caffeine)

### 4. Parallel Processing of Large Collections
**Question:** "You need to process 10 million objects with CPU-intensive calculations. How would you leverage multiple cores efficiently?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Parallel streams for automatic work distribution
- ForkJoinPool for divide-and-conquer algorithms
- ExecutorService with custom thread pools
- Work stealing for load balancing
- Measuring performance gains vs overhead
- Memory implications of parallel processing

### 5. Asynchronous Processing with CompletableFuture
**Question:** "You need to call three different REST APIs and combine their results. How would you do this asynchronously without blocking?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- CompletableFuture for asynchronous operations
- Combining futures with thenCombine()
- Error handling with handle() or exceptionally()
- Timeout handling for external calls
- Thread pool configuration for I/O operations
- Fallback mechanisms for failed services

### 6. Managing Shared Resources with Locks
**Question:** "Multiple threads need to read from and occasionally write to a shared data structure. How would you optimize for read performance?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- ReadWriteLock for read-heavy scenarios
- StampedLock for optimistic reading
- Copy-on-write collections (CopyOnWriteArrayList)
- Immutable objects to avoid locking
- Performance trade-offs of different approaches
- Lock contention monitoring

### 7. Throttling and Rate Limiting
**Question:** "You need to limit API calls to 100 requests per minute per user. How would you implement this rate limiting in a multi-threaded environment?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Token bucket algorithm implementation
- Sliding window rate limiting
- ConcurrentHashMap for per-user tracking
- Scheduled cleanup of old entries
- Memory efficiency for many users
- Distributed rate limiting considerations

### 8. Memory-Efficient Object Processing
**Question:** "Process a file with millions of objects but limit memory usage to avoid OutOfMemoryError. How would you approach this?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Streaming vs batch processing
- Iterator pattern for lazy loading
- Weak references for caches
- Object pooling for expensive objects
- JVM tuning (heap size, GC settings)
- Memory profiling and monitoring

### 9. Deadlock Prevention in Complex Systems
**Question:** "You have a system where objects need to acquire multiple locks in different orders. How would you prevent deadlocks?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Lock ordering strategies
- Timeout-based lock acquisition
- Deadlock detection and recovery
- Using single lock vs multiple locks
- Lock-free algorithms where possible
- Monitoring and alerting for deadlocks

### 10. Event-Driven Architecture with Queues
**Question:** "Design an order processing system where order creation triggers multiple async operations (inventory, payment, shipping). How would you coordinate this?"

**Expected Answer Discussion Points:**
- Message queues for loose coupling
- Event sourcing vs traditional updates
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Error handling and compensation
- Message ordering and idempotency
- Monitoring and observability
